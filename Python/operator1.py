1.Arithmatic operator:-
    1. Addition:- a + b
    2. Subtraction:- a - b
    3. Multiplication:- a * b
    4. Division:- a / y
    5. Modulus:- a % b
    6. Exponentiation:- a ** b
    7. floor division:- a // b

2. Comparison operator:-
    1. Equal to:- a == b
    2. Not equal to:- a != b
    3. Greater than:- a > b
    4. Less than:- a < b
    5. Greater than or equal to:- a >= b
    6. Less than or equal to:- a <= b
    
3. Assignment operator:-
    1. Assign:- a = b
    2. Add and assign:- a += b
    3. Subtract and assign:- a -= b
    4. Multiply and assign:- a *= b
    5. Divide and assign:- a /= b
    6. Modulus and assign:- a %= b
    7. Exponentiation and assign:- a **= b
    8. Floor division and assign:- a //= b

4. Logical operator:-
    1. And:- a and b (returns true if both statements are true)
    2. Or:- a or b (returns true if one of the statement is true)
    3. Not:- not a (reverse the result, returns false if the result is true)
    
5. Identify operators:-
    1. Is:- a is b (checks if a is same of b)
    2. Is not:- a is not b (checks if a is not same of b)
    
6. Membership operators:-
    1. In:- a in b (checks if a is present in b)
    2. Not in:- a not in b (checks if a is not present in b)
    
7. Bitwise operators:-
    1. Bitwise AND:- a & b
    2. Bitwise OR:- a | b
    3. Bitwise XOR:- a ^ b
    4. Bitwise NOT:- ~a
